Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the string in quotes is screened to the corresponding parser token as a string literal, and completes the correct functionality within the parser

Output vs expected:
-It is expected that inputting any line in double quotes will call the pStringLiteral token and output the text in the string surrounded by quotes
-pStringLiteral is called and the text is outputted as a string as per the eOutput file

Issues:
None
