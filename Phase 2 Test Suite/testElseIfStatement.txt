Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the compiler can seperate if and else if statements, to ensure it can mark the first statement as if and remaining as else if

Output vs expected:
-Expected output is that program can identify and determine which statement is the if and which are the elseifs
-Postfix stream displays a single if, encompassing the program, and elseifs/else otherwise

Issues:
None
