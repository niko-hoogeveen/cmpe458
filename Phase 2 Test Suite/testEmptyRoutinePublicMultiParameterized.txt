Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the compiler can produce the proper token stream for def functions that have multiple parameters with a public modifier

Output vs expected:
-Expected output is for program to return .sProcedure postfix to recognize routine declarations as well as necessary identifiers for the multiple parameters, and a modifier to indicate routine is public
-Procedure was returned in the postfix, displaying that the parser understands routine declarations, as well as posfix stream of paraemters for given routine, and a public token

Issues:
None
