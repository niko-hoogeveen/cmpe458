Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the double equal symbol is screened to the corresponding parser token, and completes the correct functionality within the parser

Output vs expected:
-It is expected that inputting "==" will call the pDoubleEquals token
-pDoubleEquals is called as per the eOutput file

Issues:
None
