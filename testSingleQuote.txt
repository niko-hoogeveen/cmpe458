Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the string in quotes is screened to the corresponding error token as a whole, and completes the correct functionality within the parser

Output vs expected:
-It is expected that inputting any line in single quotes will call the eIllegalChar token and output the text in the string surrounded by quotes as an error
-eIllegalChar is called and the text is outputted as an error as per the eOutput file

Issues:
None
