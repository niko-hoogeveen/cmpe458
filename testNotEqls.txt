Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the not equal symbol is screened to the corresponding parser token, and completes the correct functionality within the parser

Output vs expected:
-It is expected that inputting "!=" will call the pNotEqual token
-pNotEqual is called as per the eOutput file

Issues:
None
