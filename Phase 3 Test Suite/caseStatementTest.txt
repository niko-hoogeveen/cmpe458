Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles case statements

Expected Output:
- the correct order of tcodes to be outputted should be as follows:
  .tCaseBegin
  .... (tCode for expression)
  .tCaseSelect
  .... (body of choice)
  .tCaseMerge
  .... (body of choice)
  .tCaseMerge
  .... (body of choice)
  .tCaseMerge
  .... (case branch table)
 .tCaseElse
 .tCaseMerge
 

Output:
- As seen from .eOutput, the proper tCodes are outputted in the correct order
