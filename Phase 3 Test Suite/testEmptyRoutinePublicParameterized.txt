Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the compiler can comprehend routine declarations with a single parameter with a public modifier

Output vs expected:
-Expected output is for program to return .sProcedure postfix to recognize routine declarations as well as necessary identifiers for the single parameter, and a modifier to indicate routine is public
-Procedure was returned in the postfix, displaying that the parser understands routine declarations, as well as posfix token for the paraemter for given routine, and a public token

Issues:
None
