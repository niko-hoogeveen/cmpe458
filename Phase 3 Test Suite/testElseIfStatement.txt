Purpose of test case:
Ensure the parser can produce the proper output stream for the newly added elseif syntax.

Output vs expected:
-Expected output is that program can produce the postfix stream with proper encapsulation for the if statement and can identify the elseif syntax that is new to the compiler. 
-Postfix stream displays a single if, encompassing the program, and elseifs/else otherwise

Issues:
None
