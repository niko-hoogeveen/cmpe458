Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles usage of the index operator

Expected Output:
- the index operator takes two operators, the string we are using and the string we want to find within
- when using index we should see the proper tcodes for recognizing both strings and then .tIndex and .tAssignInteger

Output:
- The output follows exactly as we want it to. The index operators are recognized as well as the strings being used. The proper tCodes are outputted in the correct order.
