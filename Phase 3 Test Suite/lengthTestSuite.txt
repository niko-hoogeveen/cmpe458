Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles usage of the length 

Expected Output:
- the length operator takes one operator, the string we are getting the length of
- when using the length we should see the proper tcodes for recognizing the string and then .tLength and .tAssignInteger

Output:
- The output follows exactly as we want it to. The length operators are recognized as well as the strings being used. The proper tCodes are outputted in the correct order.
