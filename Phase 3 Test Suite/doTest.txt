Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles do loops

Expected Output:
- the correct order of tcodes to be outputted should be as follows:
  .tDoBegin
  ....
  .tDoBreakIf
  .tDoTest
  .tDoEnd
 
- tCodes corresponding to the body of the do loop should be outputted in place of "...."

Output:
- As seen from .eOutput, the proper tCodes are outputted in the correct order
