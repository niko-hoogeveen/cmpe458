Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles if statements in multiple different use cases

Expected Output:
- Proper sequence of if related tCodes should be emitted in each if statement case. 
- For both elsif cases, the analyzer should output a sequence of tCodes as if the statements were an else followed by a nested if statement
- For the case where there are variable assignments, the address and value of the values should be emitted within the proper if tcode statements


Output:
- As seen from .eOutput, the if statements are properly handled in every case. 
- The elsif statements are handled as an else statement with a nested if statement
- The variable assignments are recognized and properly handled within the if statements
