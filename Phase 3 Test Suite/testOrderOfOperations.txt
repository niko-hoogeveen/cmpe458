Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the parser can determine the order of operations needed by the executed code

Output vs expected:
-Expected output is for program to return the tokens in such a way that order of operations is followed and makes sense
-order of operations is followed, and postfix stream is correct for input

Issues:
None
