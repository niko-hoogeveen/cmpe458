Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles usage of the substring operator

Expected Output:
- the substring operator takes three operands, of type string substring range and outputs type string
- when using the substring operator, we should see tcode that recognizes the string, tcode of the integer range, and then tSubstring
- in the two last test cases, the types have been purposely mismatched to ensure the error has been recognized and the proper error message is outputted (#eTypeMismatch).

Output:
- The output follows exactly as we want it to. The substring operators are recognized, as well as the strings and ranges being used to calculated the substrings. 
- The erroneous usages of the substring operator are also processed properly, as the #eTypeMismatch error is outputted twice for both cases.
