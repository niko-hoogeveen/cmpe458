Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the parser can parse complex substring operations

Output vs expected:
-Expected output is that program can identify the string and substring and produce the proper output tokens from the parser.
-Substring operator was understood even within complex formats given, and was returned in parser postfix stream properly.

Issues:
None
