Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles modules. Specifically testing for functionality of procedures within modules.

Expected Output:
- no new tcodes necessary for modules
- should ignore the module intialization and initialize the procedure defined within. 
- Additonal output file included to show that the module symbol was created and put on the symbol stack when the module is initialized.
- Procedure symbols should be outputted after each module symbol, (syProcedure or syPublicProcedure)


Output:
- Each module is properly handled by the analyzer. The procedures defined within are recognized and intitialized correctly
- Four syModule symbols are created, and three procedure symbols are also created.
- The case where there is a public procedure with a parameter is handled correctly - module symbol created, syPulicProcedure symbol created and syVarParameter symbol created and placed into symbol table.
