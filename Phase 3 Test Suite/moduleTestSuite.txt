Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles modules 

Expected Output:
- no new tcodes necessary for modules
- should ignore the module intialization and continue to process the body as if it were apart of the bigger program. 
- Additonal output file included to show that the module symbol was created and put on the symbol stack when the module is initialized.
- Two modules present in test suite, and each one's body should follow the same tcodes as if they were in the main program. 


Output:
- Each module's body is processed as if it were apart of the main body of code. 
- Additonally the syModule symbol is created and placed on the symbol stack and placed in the symbol table.
