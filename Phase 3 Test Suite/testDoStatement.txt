Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the compiler can produce the proper postfix stream for do routines with declarations and statements. Additionally, testing the break if statement.

Output vs expected:
-Expected output is that program can identify and respond with the corresponding postfix for a do operation/loop
-Compiler returns do postfix tokens

Issues:
None
