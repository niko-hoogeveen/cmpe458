Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles INCORRECT variable declarations for each possible Quby type (integer, string, boolean)

Expected Output:
-Error messages for mismatched types for each declaration (#eTypeMismatch)

Output:
- For each declaration, a type mismatch error is outputted. 
- Note, the x = false declaration does not pose an error because the compiler reads false as the value 0 (integer).
