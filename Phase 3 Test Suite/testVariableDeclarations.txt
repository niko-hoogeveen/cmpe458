Purpose of test case:
To show the analyzer properly handles variable declarations for each possible Quby type (integer, string, boolean)

Expected Output:
- output the value and address of the integer variable
- output the address, length, and value of the string variable
- output the address and value of the boolean variable

Output:
- In all three cases, the correct addresses and values are outputted. Note, the memory size of an integer is 4 bytes, string is 1024 bytes and boolean is 4 bytes.
- The integer is stored at address 4 (one integer stored to initialize program), string is stored at address 8, and the boolean is stored at address 1032 
- As seen from the .eOutput file, the correct values are outputted for each variable respectively.
