Purpose of test case:
Ensure that the ampersand symbol is screened to the corresponding error token, and completes the correct functionality within the parser

Output vs expected:
-It is expected that inputting "&" will call the eIllegalChar token
-eIllegalChar is called as per the eOutput file

Issues:
None
